            <remarks>
            It is recommended to list all external libraries that your program uses which create threads/tasks which eventually hold <see cref="T:SmartLock.SmartLocker"/> objects inside your code. For example, if you use a third-party WebSocket Server, this server will probably spawn a thread per user request, and if you don't add here the WebSocket server namespace, your stack trace logging will be filled with internal WebSocket Server method calls.
